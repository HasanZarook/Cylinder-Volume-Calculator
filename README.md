# 🏺 Cylinder Volume Calculator – Java Lab 💻

This Java program calculates the **volume of a cylinder** using object-oriented programming concepts.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses a `circle1` class to calculate **area of the base circle** 🟢  
- `Cylinder` class calculates **volume** by multiplying base area with height 🏺  
- Demonstrates **composition** in Java (Cylinder has a Circle)  

---

## 🎮 How to Run

1. Compile the Java file:
```bash
javac Cylinder.java
````

2. Run the program:

```bash
java Cylinder
```

3. The program outputs the **volume of the cylinder**.

Example:

* Input: radius = 3, height = 5
* Output: `141.3`

## 💡 Notes

* Uses **π ≈ 3.14** for calculations
* Can be extended to take **user input** for radius and height
* Demonstrates **OOP principles**: composition and method usage
